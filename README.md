A very simple launcher that will launch our games, as well as give you some information about us, our games, and links to our places on the interwebs.

This launcher will only be launching the games we make in the RPG Maker engine. This launcher will also only be hosting our free RPG Maker games. Paid games will be sold sepreatly through Steam or Itch.

This launcher will only be for windows.

Some insperation came from the newer and older og minecraft launcher.
