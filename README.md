A very simple game launcher.

Some insperation came from the newer and older og minecraft launcher.

### Features:

- Time tracking per game you play. (Can be enabled in the settings)
- A loading bar that does nothing really for 35 seconds once you hit "Launch game"
- A hidden game about flowers to unlock a Easter Egg.
- Besides the hidden game there is three games in the launcher to play
- Besides the hidden game this launcher will only play RPG maker games. Most games added are RPG Maker MV and up. More to be added.
- Windows only

Right now I am making this free to play with the few current games I have made so far using the RPG Maker engine. It will always be free and I will be trying to add in more RPG Maker games myself or my team make. MY [main game project](https://github.com/safejoy/potions-panic) Potions Panic! is being made in the RPG Maker engine, however It wont get added to this launcher. It will be a standalone game and you will have to buy it.

I wanted to make a game launcher so that way for a bigger futuer game I have planned I want to make its own personal launcher. I kinda have started that game and am working on it in the Godot engine.

I might be adding in stuff like background music per game you click on so it plays it game theme music or something. Not sure what other future plans for this now. Maybe other cool colors to change it to or something. It's still a bare bones project in a way.
